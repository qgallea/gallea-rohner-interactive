## How This Site Was Built

This interactive website was built using **Claude Code** (Anthropic) as a demonstration of how AI tools can transform static academic papers into dynamic, explorable research experiences.

**Stack**: Quarto · Observable JS · D3.js · GitHub Pages

**Time to build**: ~20 minutes with Claude Code (Opus 4.6)
