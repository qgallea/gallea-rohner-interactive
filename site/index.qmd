## The Question

Since ancient times, controlling strategic trade routes has been both lucrative and violently contested — from the Strait of Salamis in 480 BC to the Strait of Kerch in 2018.

**Does globalization make conflict near these strategic locations better or worse?**

Two competing views have clashed for centuries:

:::{.callout-note icon=false}
## 🔴 Lenin's View (1917)
Globalization makes strategic locations more valuable — and more worth fighting over. Trade and economic integration *fuel* conflict.
:::

:::{.callout-note icon=false}
## 🟢 Montesquieu's View (1748)
Trade creates mutual dependence — countries prefer cooperation to keep routes open. Economic integration *curbs* conflict.
:::

This research puts both views to the test with 1.9 million observations across 30 years.

:::{.callout-important icon=false}
## The Finding
Being close to a maritime choke point **increases** conflict risk when global trade is low — but **decreases** it when trade is high enough. The tipping point occurs at a world trade openness of about 0.534 (share of GDP). Above that threshold, globalization protects strategic locations; below it, they become conflict magnets.

**Explore the results yourself:**

- [See the map](map.qmd) — where are the world's strategic choke points, and where does conflict cluster?
- [Move the slider](slider.qmd) — discover the tipping point where globalization flips from curse to cure.
- [Read the evidence](evidence.qmd) — the regression results behind the findings.
