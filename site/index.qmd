## The Question

Since ancient times, controlling strategic trade routes has been both lucrative and violently contested — from the Strait of Salamis in 480 BC to the Strait of Kerch in 2018.

**Does globalization make this better or worse?**

Two competing views have clashed for centuries:

:::{.callout-note icon=false}
## 🔴 Lenin's View (1917)
Trade and economic integration *fuel* conflict by making strategic locations more valuable and worth fighting over.
:::

:::{.callout-note icon=false}
## 🟢 Montesquieu's View (1758)
Trade *curbs* conflict by fostering interdependence — when everyone benefits from open trade routes, there's more incentive to keep the peace.
:::

This research puts both views to the test. The answer? **It depends on how much trade is flowing.**

→ [Explore the map](map.qmd) to see where strategic choke points are and how conflict clusters around them.

→ [Move the slider](slider.qmd) to discover the tipping point where globalization flips from curse to cure.
