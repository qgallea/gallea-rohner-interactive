## The Question

Since ancient times, controlling strategic trade routes has been both lucrative and violently contested — from the Strait of Salamis in 480 BC to the Strait of Kerch in 2018.

**Does globalization make conflict near these strategic locations better or worse?**

Two competing views have clashed for centuries:

:::{.callout-note icon=false}
## 🔴 Lenin's View (1917)
Globalization makes strategic locations more valuable — and more worth fighting over. Trade and economic integration *fuel* conflict.
:::

:::{.callout-note icon=false}
## 🟢 Montesquieu's View (1758)
Trade creates mutual dependence — countries prefer cooperation to keep routes open. Economic integration *curbs* conflict.
:::

This research puts both views to the test. The answer? **It depends on how much trade is flowing.**
