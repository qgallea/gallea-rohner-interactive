# Gallea & Rohner (2021) — Interactive Research Showcase

**This entire website was built with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code).**

A static PNAS paper transformed into an interactive Quarto website — with maps, sliders, regression tables, and more — as a demonstration of what Claude Code can do for academic researchers.

## What you'll find on the site

- **Interactive map** — Explore conflict events and maritime choke points worldwide
- **Causal mechanism** — Visual walkthrough of *why* globalization reduces conflict at strategic locations
- **Trade openness slider** — Drag the slider to see how the marginal effect of proximity to choke points changes with world trade
- **Regression evidence** — Key results from the paper, presented interactively
- **Policy implications** — What the findings mean for collective action and trade policy
